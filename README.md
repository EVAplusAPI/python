# Access EVA+ with Python
This is a simple python script to access EVA+ data. It requires a user on a EVA+ installation with the api permissions.
The API allows to make data available for 3rd  party applications. It allows the operator, the owner of the data to access what he wants and protect what is private.
Based on the available modules, the operator can define datasets which are accessible from outside the application.
